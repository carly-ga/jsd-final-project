Bulletproof Lists!


Generate simple, semantically correct HTML lists that render beautifully across major email and webmail clients.


Why? Because not all email clients render bulleted lists the same way, many email coders resort to simulating bullets with tables or symbols. But these solutions are less accessible than semantically correct lists.


Inspired by Paul Airy & Campaign Monitor
