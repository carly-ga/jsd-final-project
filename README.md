Email List Generator!


Abstract: 

A webpage that generates...

1) Simple, semantically correct HTML lists, with inline styling that works across major email and webmail clients:
	-Apple Mail macOS, Apple Mail iOS
	-Gmail: Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer
	-Yahoo! Mail: Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer
	-AOL Mail: Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer
	-Outlook.com: Safari, Firefox, Chrome, Explorer
	-Outlook 2007, 2010, 2013, 2016: Explorer

2) A Microsoft conditional comment that the user needs to include in their email head tag, to make the styles work in the Outlook desktop clients listed above.



Needs Statement:

Because email clients are so inconsistent about list rendering, many email coders resort to simulating bullets with the &bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; method. However, the effect is lost if the text wraps, and the solution is less accessible than semantically correct lists.
